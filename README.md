# VIRTUAL-MOUSE
 Gesture And Voice Controlled  Virtual Mouse Using CNN
  By controlling cursor movement with a real-time camera and microphone, this project
 advances the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) paradigm in the field of computer
 science.
 The following are the objectives of the project:
 ● Design for mouse operation with the aid of a webcam. The Virtual Mouse
 technology works with the help of a webcam, which takes real-time photos
 and photographs. A webcam is required for the application to function.
 ● The cursor is assigned to a certain screen position when the hand
 gesture/motion is converted into a mouse operation. The Virtual Mouse
 application is set up to identify the position of the mouse pointers by detecting
 the position of the fingertips and knuckles on a defined hand colour and
 texture.
 ● Develop a multi user independent speech recognition system that captures
 voice in real-time with the help of a microphone and is able to retrieve
 folders, sub-folders, documents, copy, paste, left click, right click and double
 click by taking voice command and checking its validity.
 ● Create a voice-activated mouse system that works in tandem with the
 gesture-activated system
 The physical mouse has a number of flaws, including the following:
 ● The physical mouse experiences wear and tear.
 ● To operate hardware and software, the physical mouse requires a particular
 surface.
 ● The physical mouse is incompatible in a variety of scenarios..
 ● Depending on the setting, performance varies.
 ● Even in today's operational conditions, the mouse has limited capabilities.
 ● Each period of usability for wired and wireless mice is distinct..
